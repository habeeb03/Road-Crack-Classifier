{% if result == "Alligator" %}
<h3>Alligator Crack</h3>
<ol>
 <li>Causes : </li>
  <ol>
     <li>Excessive deflection of pavement surface normally in wheel paths.</li>
     <li>Inadequate pavement thickness.</li>
     <li>Weakening of subgrade or lower layers of the pavement due to ingress of excessive
moisture to pavement and saturation.</li>
      <li>Overloading of heavy commercial vehicles.</li>
      <li>Brittleness of binder due to ageing of binder and lowering of surface temperature due to weather conditions.</li>
  <li>Stripping of underlying bituminous courses</li>
 </ol>
</li>
<li>Treatment:</li>
  <ol>
     <li>Crack sealing by bitumen emulsions</li>
     <li>Crack sealing by rubberized and modified bitumen</li>
     <li>Milling and surface recycling</li>
 </ol>
</ol>
{% elif result == "Longitudinal" %}
<h3>Longitudinal Crack</h3>
<ol>
<li>Causes : </li>
 <ol>
 <li>Caused by alternate wetting and drying beneath the shoulder surface or by improper/weak joints
between adjoining layers of pavement.</li>
 </ol>
</li>
<li>Treatment:</li>
 <ol>
    <li>Low and medium Severity Cracks: Crack sealing, preferably using rubberised bitumen</li>
    <li>High Severity Cracks: Remove and replace the cracked pavement layer with fresh overlay.</li>
 </ol>
</ol>
{% elif result == "Ravelling" %}
<h3>Ravelling</h3>
<ol>
 <li>Causes : </li>
  <ol>
      <li>Inadequate bitumen content in a mix</li>
      <li>Overheating of bitumen during mixing process</li>
      <li>Inadequate compaction during construction</li>
      <li>Excessive ageing of binder.</li>

 </ol>
</li>
<li>Treatment:</li>
 <ol>
     <li>Low severity ravelling: The low severity ravelling may be corrected by application of
fog seal,sand seal, seal coat, slurry seal or microsurfacing</li>
     <li>Medium severity ravelling: This may be corrected by application of seal coat, slurry
seal or micro surfacing treatment in affected area</li>
     <li>High severity ravelling: May be corrected by single or multiple applications of liquid
seal coat, slurry seal, microsurfacing and surfacing of thin overlay of appropriate mix specification
like
mix seal surfacing or open graded premix carpet.</li>
 </ol>
</ol>
{% elif result == 'Pothole' %}
<h3>PotHoles</h3>
<ol>
<li>Causes : </li>
<ol>
 <li>Loss of adhesion in a bituminous wearing coat due to the ingress of water into the pavement or due to higher voids in the surface.</li>
 <li>Insufficient bitumen content in localized areas of the surfacing layer.</li>
 <li>Lack of proper bond between the bituminous surfacing and the underlying water bound macadam base layer.</li>
 </ol>
</li>
<li>Treatment:</li>
 <ol>
     <li>The rectification consists of filling pot-holes with open graded or dense graded premix.</li>
